# Version Notation
IFC versions are identified using the sematic versioning notation "Major.Minor.Addendum.Corrigendum".

- Major versions consist of scope expansions or deletions and may have changes that break compatibility.
- Minor versions consist of feature extensions, where compatibility is guaranteed for the "core" schema, but not for other definitions.
- Addendums consist of improvements to existing features, where the schema may change but upward compatibility is guaranteed.
- Corrigendums consist of improvements to documentation, where the schema does not change though deprecation is possible.
