<h2 id="data-model">Data model</h2>

The bSDD is a service to facilitate the distribution of data dictionaries (read below about what those are) published by independent organisations. The diagram below shows the simplified data model behind the bSDD:

See our example demonstrating the usage of the above concepts: [bSDD data example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/master/Documentation/graphics/bSDD_data_example.png):

We also have a demonstration dictionary: ["Fruit and vegetables"](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/bs-agri/fruitvegs/1.1).

<h2 id="json-format">JSON format</h2>

You can deliver data for the buildingSMART Data Dictionary in the JSON file following our standard, which we explain in this document. You can also find the JSON and Excel templates in [/Model/Import Model](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/tree/master/Model/Import%20Model).

Click on the link to get the list of allowed codes for [countries](https://api.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/api/Country/v1), [languages](https://api.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/api/Language/v1), [units](https://api.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/api/Unit/v1), [reference documents](https://api.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/api/ReferenceDocument/v1) and [ifc class](https://api.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/api/Dictionary/v2/Classes?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fidentifier.buildingsmart.org%2Furi%2Fbuildingsmart%2Fifc%2F4.3).
If you think there are reference documents missing, please let us know by [posting an issue](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/issues). All values in JSON must be strings captured in double quotes, including for numeric Example and AllowedValue fields.

If you are unfamiliar with JSON, we recommend reading [Introduction to JSON](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/jsonp001.html). Please note that JSON is a format meant for computer systems to exchange data. If you have your dictionary data in a computer system, then it's best to let the system create the JSON for you.

<h2 id="list-of-fields">List of fields</h2>

NB Default values will only be applied if a field is not specified. If you specify a field value of "null", the default will not be applied. Note that "null" is not allowed for all fields.

<h3 id="Dictionary">Dictionary</h3>

`Data dictionary` - '_a centralized repository of information about data such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin usage and format._' [ISO23386]. '_database that contains metadata_' [ISO12006-3]. Each `Dictionary` (previously `domain`) consists of `Classes` (previously `classifications`) and `Properties`, which could be related to each other or with other `Dictionaries`. Each `Dictionary` object contains general metadata about it, as listed in the table below.

| Field            | DataType         | Requ- ired? | Trans- latable? | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |

| <span id="OrganizationCode">OrganizationCode</span> | Text             | ✅    | | The organisation's code received when registering in bSDD. If your organisation doesn't have a code yet, request one at [bSDD User Helpdesk](https://bsi-technicalservices.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/group/4/create/25). The code should be preferably short, as it will appear in all the URI links. See section [Code format](#code-format) explaining allowed characters. This code can't start with a digit. Example code: "ifc".   |

\* For delivering data in additional languages, it is sufficient to fill the `Dictionary` type fields, all `Code` fields and the fields marked with `Translatable?` = "Yes" of the other types. Ensure that the `OrganizationCode`, `DictionaryCode` and `DictionaryVersion` are exactly the same and if the data is for adding a language to an existing `Dictionary`, set the field `LanguageOnly` to true.

<h3 id="Class">Class</h3>

`Class` - '_description of a set of objects that share the same characteristics._' [ISO23386]. A `Class` can be any object (examples: "wall", "window") or abstract concept (examples: "time", "room") or process (examples: "installation", "disassembly").

Note: Since the release of November 2023, Materials are not treated separately anymore. A `Material` is now simply a `Class` of type `Material`.

<h3 id="Property">Property</h3>

`Property` - '_an inherent or acquired feature of an item [`Class`]. Example: Thermal efficiency, heat flow, (...), colour._' [ISO23386].  The assignment of `Properties` to `Classes` is handled through the interim [ClassProperty](#ClassProperty) object.

<h3 id="ClassProperty">ClassProperty</h3>

Interim object to assign a `Property` to a `Class` it should describe. Each `Class` can have multiple properties, and each `Property` can be part of many `Classes`, but one `ClassProperty` is always a pair of one `Class` and one `Property`. 

Through `ClassProperty`, one can further specify a 'Property' by defining its unit, property set it should be stored in, and value restrictions when applied to that particular `Class`. For example, a general 'Temperature' can be expressed in Celcius or Fahrenheit and can be any negative or positive value, but when applied to an indoor space, it might be restricted to a range of 5-40 degrees Celcius.

<h3 id="code-format">Code format</h3>

(from April 2024) All codes support diacritics, whitespace, dots, commas, dashes, round brackets (parentheses) underscores and numbers. Not allowed are special characters: ```"#%/\:`{}[]|;<>?~```. Codes are not case-sensitive, and we recommend using small-caps only. 

Some examples of valid codes are: "bs-agri", "apple", "éÄą _- (Д開発,...żź)".

Codes need to be unique within the same data dictionary and are used to generate URIs.

Some codes might be reserved, for example, the IFC standard reserves the codes starting with a prefix 'Ifc' and 'Pset'.

Each class must have a specific type. Below is the explanation of what each type means, according to ISO 12006-3:
* `Class` - description of a set of objects that share the same characteristics <sup>[ISO12006-3,3.7]</sup>. This is the most common type in bSDD. (Example: wall, space)
* `GroupOfProperties` - collection enabling the properties to be prearranged or organized <sup>[ISO12006-3,3.14]</sup>. For example, 'environmental properties'. See [assembling properties](#assembling-properties).
* `Material` - a physical substance that things can be made from (Example: steel, glass)
* `AlternativeUse` - type to be used if no other type fits the needs.<sup>[ISO12006-3,3.1]</sup>.
   * Be aware that most software implementations disregard this class type, as it is not straightforward to interpret.
* **DEPRECATED** ~~ReferenceDocument - a publication that is consulted to find specific information, particularly in a technical or scientific dictionary. <sup>[ISO12006-3,3.18]</sup>. A reference document can be associated with any data present in a data dictionary.~~
  * In bSDD we have a global list of [reference documents](https://api.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/api/ReferenceDocument/v1), which includes the most common standards that can be used as reference. This is to avoid having duplicate references with different naming. If you don't find the reference you are looking for, and think it should be added to the list - let us know: [CONTACT FORM](https://share.hsforms.com/1RtgbtGyIQpCd7Cdwt2l67A2wx5h).
* **DEPRECATED**  ~~ComposedProperty - (...) corresponding to a feature needing multiple properties to be defined. <sup>[ISO12006-3,3.8]</sup>.~~
  * ~~Example: To describe the characteristic "concrete facing quality", it is mandatory to describe 3 properties: concrete planarity, concrete hue, and concrete texture.~~
  * Use `GroupOfProperties` instead.

<h3 id="defining-relations">Defining relations</h3>

`ParentClassCode` - `Class`es within the same dictionary can be organized in a tree-like hierarchy structure. For example: “IfcCurtainWall” is a more
specific class of “IfcWall”. In bSDD terminology, we say that “IfcWall” is a **parent of** “IfcCurtainWall”. To define such specialization relation, use the `ParentClassCode` attribute on the child object.

`ClassRelation` and `PropertyRelation`- use those to link your concepts with each other. Relations allow us to define parent-child links also with other dictionaries. Apart from specialization, you can also define other types of relations, such as decomposition (`HasPart` type, see the list of possible types: [Relation types](#relation-types)).

`RelatedIfcEntityNamesList` - IFC is a top-level schema (foundation classes) used for exchanging information between software. Because of that, the bSDD provides a special way to relate your class to IFC. Use `RelatedIfcEntityNamesList` to show which entities from IFC you are referring to or extending. For example, “Signaling LED diode” relates to “IfcLamp” from IFC. `RelatedIfcEntityNamesList` can be used by bSDD-related tools to filter the list of possible classes to a particular IFC category.

<h3 id="relation-types">Relation types</h3>

`Properties` and `Classes` can be related to each other. Each relation must have a specific type to allow software to interpret it. Below is an explanation of what each type means:
* <span id='IsEqualTo'>`IsEqualTo`</span> - if two concepts are unequivocal and have the same name, code, definition and description. Classes also need to share the same class properties. It is quite rare for concepts to be equal. An example of usage is when a concept doesn't have an official translation, but someone defines a new dictionary with that concept in a new language and wants to say it is exactly the same as the original. (We always recommend proposing translations and improvements to the original data dictionaries instead of building duplicate ones). 
* <span id='IsSimilarTo'>`IsSimilarTo`</span> - if two concepts are almost equal but differ by name, code, definition, description or set of class properties. This is a very common relationship type. Used, for example, to say that 'IfcWall' is a similar concept to 'Wall System' from CCI. The downside of such a relation is that it doesn't inform on the level of similarity – is it slightly differing by the wording of the definition, or is the difference huge?
* <span id='HasReference'>`HasReference`</span> - if two concepts relate to each other, but other relation types do not apply. For example, "wall lamp" (or "sconce") is referencing a wall, even though those are different concepts and there is no hierarchy between them.
* **DEPRECATED** ~~IsSynonymOf - if two concepts are unequivocal but have a different name.~~

Only applicable to classes (not properties):
* <span id='IsChildOf'>`IsChildOf`</span> - specialisation relation. The equivalent of the "subtype" relationship <sup>[ISO12006-3, F3.1]</sup>. For example: "Electrical motor" and a "Combustion motor" are children (subtypes) of the generic concept "Motor".
* <span id='IsParentOf'>`IsParentOf`</span> - the opposite relation to `IsChildOf`.
* <span id='HasPart'>`HasPart`</span> - composition relation. For example, an electric motor can be composed of elements such as stators, rotors, etc. <sup>[ISO12006-3, F3.2]</sup>.
* <span id='IsPartOf'>`IsPartOf`</span> - reverse of `HasPart`.
* <span id='HasMaterial'>`HasMaterial`</span> - a class that can be associated with a particular material. For example: "Steel Beam" could be related to the material "Steel".

<h3 id="datetime-format">DateTime format</h3>

The date-time format according to the ISO 8601 series should be used: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD`. Import allows both: `2023-05-10`, `2023-05-10T15:10:12Z` and `2023-05-10T15:10:12+02:00`.

<h3 id="property-inheritance">Property inheritance</h3>

* Parent `Class` → child `Class`  
The child `Class` does not inherit properties from the parent `Class`. If authors want child classes to also have properties of parent classes, they should specify them intentionally in import files.  
For example, the [IfcWall](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc/4.3/class/IfcWall) is a parent class of [IfcWallStandardCase](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc/4.3/class/IfcWallStandardCase). While [IfcWall](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc/4.3/class/IfcWall) has the property [AcousticRating](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc/4.3/class/IfcWall/prop/Pset_WallCommon/AcousticRating), the [IfcWallStandardCase](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc/4.3/class/IfcWallStandardCase) doesn't.

* `Property` → `ClassProperty`  
`ClassProperty` is an instantiation of general `Property` for a particular `Class`. The attributes of a property, such as `AllowedValue` and min/max restrictions,  are by default passed to `ClassProperty`. The values of the `ClassProperty` can be modified without influencing the origin `Property`.  
For example, the [Height](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/bs-agri/fruitvegs/1.0.0/prop/height) has an upper limit of 100 cm. When applied to the "Apple" class, the [Apple-Height](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/bs-agri/fruitvegs/1.0.0/class/apple/prop/SizeSet/height) has a lower limit - 25cm. 

<h3 id="latest-version">Latest version</h3>

In bSDD, all resources get a unique identifier - URI. The URI, among other information, contains codes of the organisation, the dictionary and the version number, for example .../uri/bs-agri/fruitvegs/**1.0.0**/class/fruit
If you want to reference specific resources but are not sure of the version or want to always point to the most recent version, we implemented the "latest" feature. Now, it is possible to use "latest" instead of a version number, and bSDD will resolve the link to the latest active or preview version containing that resource: 
.../uri/bs-agri/fruitvegs/**latest**/class/fruit. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/master/Documentation/graphics/latest_example.jpg" alt="bSDD latest" style="width: 750px"/>

Try it out:
https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/bs-agri/fruitvegs/latest/class/fruit

⚠️ The "latest" points to the most recent resource, meaning that it will change once a new version is present. Use with caution as it is not an immutable URI, and the content can change. For contractual agreements, we suggest using specific version numbers.

<h3 id="assembling-properties">Assembling properties</h3>

**Groups of Properties** (use `Class`.`ClassType`:`GroupOfProperties`) "collection enabling the properties to be prearranged or organized" <sup>[ISO12006-3,3.14]</sup>. In bSDD, implemented as a Type of Class meant to group multiple Properties.

Use Group of Properties to organize properties in a data dictionary.

Example: _'[Global Warming Potential](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/LCA/LCA/3.0/class/GlobalWarmingPotential)' class from '[LCA indicators and modules](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/LCA/LCA/3.0)' groups four properties: '[...total](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/LCA/LCA/3.0/prop/GWP_total)', '[...biogenic](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/LCA/LCA/3.0/prop/GWP_biogenic)', '[...fossil fuels](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/LCA/LCA/3.0/prop/GWP_fossil)' and '[...land use...](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/LCA/LCA/3.0/prop/GWP_luluc)'._

**Sets of properties** (use `ClassProperty`.`PropertySet`) - a concept from the IFC standard for grouping properties. In bSDD represented as a text field defined for Class Property, telling in which set this Class Property should appear when serialised to IFC data. 
  * A Property Set, as defined in ISO 16739-1, is a group of properties, but a group of properties is not necessarily a Property Set.
  * A property can be a member of several groups of properties. A class property cannot be a member of several Property Sets.
  * The prefix 'Pset_' is only reserved for the official IFC.

Use Property Set to define where to place a property in an IFC dataset.

Example: _A property 'Concrete Cover' of 'IfcWall' is located in property set: 'Pset_ConcreteElementGeneral'._

**Connected properties** (use `Property`.`ConnectedPropertyCodes`) "List of properties connected to the current property. The connection can be a specialization or a dependency." <sub>[ISO12006-3, 5.3.29]</sub> 

Use Connected Properties if the value of one property depends on the value of another property.

Example: _The property ['Global Warming Potential - total' (GWP)](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/LCA/LCA/3.0/prop/GWP_total) should be defined for each phase of the life cycle of a product. Defining the property separately for each phase (GWP_A1, GWP_A2, ...) is not desired. Instead, it is connected to another property - '[information module (PHASE)](https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/LCA/LCA/3.0/prop/information_module)', taking 18 possible values (A1, A2, C3...). To interpret the meaning of GWP value, one should look at pairs of values: {GWP=1.0, PHASE=A1}, {GWP=15.0, PHASE=A3}, etc. _

⚠️ This feature comes from the ISO standard but is rarely supported by software implementation. The IFC also doesn't support multiple properties with the same name under one property set. Consider avoiding Connected Properties to make the data dictionary more accessible.

**Dynamic properties** (use `Property`.`IsDynamic` and .`DynamicParameterPropertyCodes`) "properties which are parameters of the function for a dynamic property" <sub>[ISO23386, 5.3.29]</sub>. In other words, the value of a dynamic property is dependent on the values of properties specified in `DynamicParameterPropertyCodes`. There is no field in bSDD to define the exact equation of the formula in a machine-interpretable form. 

Use Dynamic Properties to tell which other properties influence the value of the particular property.

Example: _The 'Area' of a wall depends on its 'Height' and 'Length', following the formula: A = H * L._

⚠️ This feature comes from the ISO standard but is rarely supported by software implementation. Consider avoiding Dynamic Properties to make the data dictionary more accessible.

It is possible to reference other resources from the same dictionary using double square brackets, and the platform will replace the brackets with hyperlinks pointing to that resource. In cases where the same code exists for both class and property, the hyperlink will point to the class. If the code is not found, the square brackets are omitted. The API returns the definition with square brackets.

**2023-07 - Important notification:**

> As we're continuously improving bSDD, we've updated all identifiers: the dash between dictionary code and dictionary version has been replaced by a slash, Example:
>  https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/bs-agri/fruitvegs-1.0.0/class/apple will now be https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/bs-agri/fruitvegs/1.0.0/class/apple
> 
> We will support supplying and retrieving data using the dash between dictionary code and version for (at least) 4 months. But please do note that only identifiers in the new format are returned by the bSDD APIs.

**2022-08 - Important notification:**

> The bSDD is in the process of moving from identifiers (aka "URI") starting with "http://identifier.buildingsmart.org" to "https://identifier.buildingsmart.org" ("http" to "https"). This is to ease the use of these identifiers as hyperlinks as well.
> 
> Support for using the old "http" identifiers will be deprecated soon!
