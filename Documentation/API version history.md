# bSDD API version history

This is the version history of the API at https://api.bsdd.buildingsmart.org.

New APIs and updates will always first be published to the bSDD test environment: https://test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org

For planned updates and other tech discussions, see [bSDD tech updates forum](https://forums.buildingsmart.org/t/bsdd-tech-updates/4889).

# Versioning strategy
A new version will only be created if it 'breaks' the current version. For example, adding a new field to the output of an API does NOT (or should not) break your app. Removing an output field on the other hand is a breaking change and will result in a new version of that API.

If there is a new version of an API the previous version will be supported for at least 6 months after releasing the new version.

## 2023-11-08

Name changes:
 * Classification ==> Class
 * Domain ==> Dictionary
 * NamespaceUri ==> Uri
 * IncludeChilds ==> IncludeChildren

This involves all APIs either with one of these names in the API name itself, in the input contract or in the output contract. For all these APIs new versions, some with new names, have been created. Existing APIs will remain for at least 6 months after go live but we advise you to use the new APIs.

Other changes:
 * "Materials" are not treated separately anymore, they are just Classes with type being Material.
 * Import field ClassificationProperty.ExternalPropertyUri has been removed completely. The field PropertyNamespaceUri (which is now called PropertyUri) already replaced it.
 * Search APIs now support pagination

Changed APIs:
 * api/Class/v1: new, replaces api/Classification/v4
    - Option includeClassProperties added. If true, classProperties will be fetched. Default is false.
    - Option includeClassRelations added. If true, classRelations will be fetched. Default is false.
    - New output field: Class.Description
 * api/Class/Search/v1: new, replaces api/ClassificationSearchOpen/v1.
    - Return contract now contains just one dictionary instead of a list of dictionaries which always contains one item.
    - Supports pagination
 * api/Dictionary/v1: new, replaces api/Domain/v3
    - Supports pagination

    - Supports pagination
  * api/UploadImportFile/v1: updated, it accepts both old and new import json. Support for old import json will become deprecated.

All replaced APIs still work for now but are marked as obsolete, as can be seen on the swagger page https://test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/swagger.
